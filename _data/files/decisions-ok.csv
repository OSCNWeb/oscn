After text messages between the alleged victim and Pearman's ex-wife, Theresa Marie Pearman (Theresa) revealed that the VPO filing was a collaboration between the Tess and Theresa to obtain custody in a child custody dispute against Pearman, Tess withdrew the petition. Pearman sought to have the VPO filing declared frivolous, and to recover attorney fees and costs, pursuant to  22 O.S. Supp. 2013 &sect;60.2 . The trial judge denied his request. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. We hold that, pursuant to 22 O.

Loyd did not appeal, and the order became final. Less than a month after such order was issued, Loyd filed a Form 9 requesting continuing medical maintenance and requesting a portion of his permanent partial disability award be commuted to a lump sum payment. Upon consideration, we hold that a claimant may seek to commute his or her permanent partial disability award  after  the hearing on permanent partial disability under  85 O.S. 2001 &sect; 41 (A). Additionally, we conclude that because Loyd did not request reservation of continuing medical maintenance and the trial court's order awarding permanent partial disability did not address or reserve the issue of continuing medical maintenance, Loyd's only recourse was to seek continuing medical maintenance through a reopening proceeding under  85 O.S. 2001 &sect; 28 .","5/25/2016 11:47:52 AM"
