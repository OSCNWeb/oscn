Before entering his plea, Petitioner made it clear to the municipal court and to Respondent (""the City"") that he did not contest his guilt, but that he wished to challenge the City's authority to prescribe any penalty for speeding in excess of the penalty prescribed by state law (which, in this case, would be $10.00), and the municipal court's authority to impose same. The parties briefed the issue for the municipal court. On December 2, 2015, the Honorable Donald Kiffin, Municipal Judge, rejected Petitioner's argument and fined him $84.00. Petitioner timely filed a motion to withdraw his plea, reiterating his sole claim that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law. The motion was denied on December 15, 2015, and Petitioner timely gave notice of intent to appeal. Because Petitioner timely raised his claim below, before and after entry of his plea, and because the claim involves the municipal court's legal authority to impose the sentence it did, the claim is cognizable in this  certiorari  appeal.
