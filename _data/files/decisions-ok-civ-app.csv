Manar have an easement by prescription to use a roadway crossing property owned by the Wessons. The Manars appeal the trial court's finding that the road is not a public road. The clear weight of the evidence shows the road was not dedicated to public use nor was there prescription of the way by the public when it was a wagon trail; we therefore affirm the trial court's finding on that question. The clear weight of the evidence also shows, however, that the road was built and used with the permission of the Wessons' predecessors and therefore the trial court erred in finding the Manars have an easement by prescription. Permissive use of a road is a license which does not ripen into an easement. At most the Manars had a license which the Wessons were free to revoke. We therefore reverse the trial court's finding that the Manars have an easement.","5/4/2016 3:24:27 PM"
