Nichols, Jr. (Nichols/driver), appealed the suspension of his driver's license by the defendant/appellant, State of Oklahoma, ex. rel., Department of Public Safety (State/Department), in an administrative proceeding for driving under the influence (DUI). Nichols alleged that the Department's delay of a revocation hearing for a period of approximately sixteen (16) months from the initial notice of a request for a hearing until his cause was heard violated his right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect;6. The trial court agreed, setting aside the revocation order and reinstating Nichols' driving privileges. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed and the driver sought certiorari. Our decision in  Pierce v. State, ex. rel., Dept. of Public Safety , ( Pierce ),  2014 OK 37 ,  327 P.3d 530  is determinative of some issues and instructive of others. We hold that the driver's right to a speedy hearing, guaranteed by the Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect;6, was violated and we order reinstatement of Nichols' driving privileges. The number of similar causes pending in the courts makes it expedient to provide guidance to the Department and the public in considering the constitutionally guaranteed right of a speedy hearing in driver revocation proceedings. The parameters set forth will avoid unnecessary litigation and protect those using our streets and highways by timely revoking driving privileges from those who choose to operate vehicles while driving under the influence.","","OK"

Bebout to probate mineral interests owned by R.V. Bebout in Canadian County at the time of his death. The Final Order in the Estate of R.V. Bebout, filed in 1982, distributed his mineral interests to his daughter and granddaughter in equal shares pursuant to the terms of his will. In 2014, R.V. Bebout's grandsons, filed this action in Canadian County, alleging that the mineral interest distribution in the Estate of R.V. Bebout was void to the extent it failed to distribute the mineral interests one-quarter each to his grandsons who were pretermitted heirs under the will. Citing this Court's decision in  Booth v. McKnight ,  2003 OK 49 ,  70 P.3d 855 , the District Court agreed with the grandsons and found the Final Order issued in 1982 in the Estate of R.V. Bebout was void on its face for lack of proper notice to the grandsons. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. We conclude that notice to the grandsons was constitutionally sufficient, and thus, the Final Order was not void for lack of proper notice. Grandsons' challenge to the Final Order more than thirty years later is untimely.","","OK"

It also ordered each party to pay their own attorney fees. Mother appealed both judgments in separate companion cases, and both were affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.

Ross appeals a decision of the district court finding that the City of Owasso properly refused disclosure of a record known as the ""Fortney Report"" pursuant to the Open Records Act. On review, we affirm that the Fortney Report is a ""personnel record"" which may be subject to discretionary release pursuant to the provisions of  51 O.S. Supp. 2014, &sect; 24A.7 (A). We find, however, that the Owasso City Council has never exercised its discretion to decide the status of the report pursuant to &sect; 24A.7(A). We therefore vacate in part the summary judgment and remand this matter for a decision by the City Council.","1/17/2017 7:52:05 AM","OK CIV APP"

In its counter-appeal, the Authority asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction because Stripling failed to timely file her petition. Both appeals result from the district court's disposition of the Authority's motion to dismiss Stripling's appeal. The appeal has been assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36, 12 O.S. Supp. 2013, ch. 15, app. 1, and the matter stands submitted without appellate briefing. The district court denied the Authority's motion seeking dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and that aspect of the district court's order is affirmed. The district court granted the Authority's motion to dismiss pursuant to  12 O.S.2011 &sect; 2012 (B)(6), based on its finding that Stripling's petition failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Because that ground is inapplicable to the judicial review procedure required by  12 O.S.2011 &sect; 951 , this case must be remanded for further consideration of Stripling's appeal.","1/24/2017 9:51:43 AM","OK CIV APP"

Mangum had previously sold the truck to Cook and retained a security interest in the truck to secure repayment of the amount of the purchase price he financed for Cook. The dispute involves the amount of the payoff due Mangum for the truck. Bryan's tendered the amount stated in a written payoff statement from Mangum's employee. Mangum refused this amount and refused to release his lien, contending that the amount tendered was less than the balance due on Cook's loan. The case was tried to the district court. Judgment was entered in favor of Bryan's ordering Mangum to release its lien. Although the amount stated in Mangum's payoff statement was not the full amount Cook owed to Mangum, the district court found that Bryan's tendered the amount in the payoff statement before that amount was withdrawn. Consequently, Bryan's tender of the amount in Mangum's payoff statement was sufficient to discharge Mangum's lien, and we affirm.","2/23/2017 11:49:12 AM","OK CIV APP"
