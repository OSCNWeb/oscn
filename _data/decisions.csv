One District Court proceeding sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board of Adjustment and County Commissioners. The second proceeding was filed in the District Court as an appeal from an order by the Osage County Board of Adjustment. Upon conclusion of a combined hearing on both proceedings, the District Court, Hon. Robert G. Haney, District Judge, dismissed the actions by a single journal entry of judgment and Plaintiffs appealed. The Court retained the appeals. We hold: (1) In appeal No. 113, 414, all claims for injunctive and declaratory relief by the Osage Nation are barred by laches except one claim for a declaratory judgment against governmental entities on the validity of a zoning ordinance, and this claim is remanded with instructions; (2) In appeal No. 113,415, the Osage Nation's 2014 appeal to the District Court from a board of adjustment decision was untimely to review a permit issued by that board more than two years previously and other issues raised in No. 113,415 are not reviewable on appeal due to a lack of a supporting record.","","OK"

Cantrell, District Judge for Tulsa County granted insurer's motion for summary judgment. The judgment was appealed and affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. We hold buyer's action in this case for breach of the implied-in-law duty of good faith by an insurer is based upon his status as an insured or third party beneficiary; and buyer's equitable title to property arising from a contract for deed is insufficient by itself to confer upon him the status of an insured.

A jury returned a verdict that found Mother failed to correct those conditions. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict and terminated Mother's parental rights to B.K. Mother appealed. Upon review, a majority of Division II of the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment of termination. The Court observed that the undisputed evidence revealed Mother's mental disorder was the cause of B.K. being adjudicated deprived, not deficiencies in parenting. The majority opinion held that any termination must be based on the mental health ground found in 10A O.S.Supp.2014 &sect; 1-4-904(B)(13) and, therefore, it was fundamental error to terminate pursuant to 10A O.S.Supp. 2014 &sect; 1-4-904(B)(5).

In accordance with the jury's recommendation the Honorable Greg Dixon sentenced Bosse to three sentences of death (Counts I-III), and thirty-five (35) years imprisonment and a fine of $25,000.00 (Count IV), to run consecutively.

They appeal the district court's September 22, 2015 and October 21, 2015 orders denying their motions for partial summary judgment and granting Appellee Vanessa Pierce's motions for partial summary judgment.  1   Appellants' motions challenged the validity of Pierce's devise in his 2013 Will of an interest in real property to Vanessa and their minor son, CP, arguing that the devise was superseded by a prenuptial agreement between Vanessa and Pierce. Appellants also argue that the devise to Vanessa and her son was ineffective to exercise a power of appointment regarding the property granted to Pierce in a trust that held title to the property. The district court's ruling that the devise in Pierce's Will was not precluded by the parties' prenuptial agreement is affirmed. The district court's ruling that the devise to Vanessa of a life estate in the property was invalid because she was not an object of the power of appointment is also affirmed. Finally, we affirm the district court's ruling that Pierce did effectively exercise his power of appointment regarding this real property in favor of his minor son.","5/11/2017 2:24:20 PM","OK CIV APP"

Meadows appeals the dismissal by the Oklahoma Tax Commission of his April 23, 2014 Application for Hearing. In that document, Meadows argued the Commission erred when it failed to enforce state income tax withholding law concerning a distribution from his employer-sponsored retirement account. The administrative law judge assigned to the matter treated Meadows' Application as an attempt to appeal the denial of two previous settlement proposals and determined that he did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter. The judge recommended that the Commission's Compliance Division's response to Meadows' Application be treated as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and be granted. The Commission adopted the administrative law judge's recommendation and dismissed Meadows' Application for Hearing. Because Meadows has abandoned any review of the denial of his settlement proposals, we vacate the Commission's order and remand this case for a hearing on Meadows' claim that the Commission failed to enforce Oklahoma withholding law.  1  ","5/11/2017 2:23:43 PM","OK CIV APP"

Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were residents at Epworth Villa's Oklahoma City facility when Mrs. Hicks suffered a broken wrist while under the care of Epworth Villa in its specialized, memory care unit. Mr. Hicks filed suit against Epworth Villa for breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (""IIED"") seeking both actual and punitive damages. On appeal Epworth Villa argues the trial court erred when it entered default judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract and negligence claims as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery orders. Epworth Villa also argues the trial court erred by ordering additional sanctions in the form of default judgment on Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages and by eliminating Epworth Villa's right to jury trial on the IIED claim. Further, Epworth Villa asserts the trial court erred in allowing the IIED claim to be tried and that the actual and punitive damages awarded by the court were excessive and not supported by the evidence. Additionally, Epworth Villa objects to the trial court's award of attorney fees and costs to Mr. Hicks, which was appealed separately from the underlying judgment and consolidated with this appeal by order of the Supreme Court.","5/11/2017 2:23:07 PM","OK CIV APP"

Brune. Brune was hired to defend an insured in a personal injury action pursuant to an insurance policy issued by American Transport Insurance Company. Brune was contacted by Crawford as the agent and third-party administrator for American. When American failed to pay for his services, Brune sued American and Crawford and individual employees of each company. Brune obtained a judgment against American for breach of contract. The district court then granted Brune's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that Crawford was a party to the contract between Brune and American and was liable for American's breach of that contract. Although the case was also tried on other liability issues and damages, the jury was instructed that, as a matter of law, Crawford was liable to Brune for American's breach of its contract with Brune. We find dispositive Crawford's appeal of that portion of the judgment entered on the jury's verdict awarding damages to Brune against Crawford for American's breach of contract. Because Brune's motion for partial summary judgment was granted in error, the entire judgment against Crawford must be vacated and this case remanded for further proceedings.","6/20/2017 10:32:58 AM","OK CIV APP"
