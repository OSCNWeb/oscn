Bebout to probate mineral interests owned by R.V. Bebout in Canadian County at the time of his death. The Final Order in the Estate of R.V. Bebout, filed in 1982, distributed his mineral interests to his daughter and granddaughter in equal shares pursuant to the terms of his will. In 2014, R.V. Bebout's grandsons, filed this action in Canadian County, alleging that the mineral interest distribution in the Estate of R.V. Bebout was void to the extent it failed to distribute the mineral interests one-quarter each to his grandsons who were pretermitted heirs under the will. Citing this Court's decision in  Booth v. McKnight ,  2003 OK 49 ,  70 P.3d 855 , the District Court agreed with the grandsons and found the Final Order issued in 1982 in the Estate of R.V. Bebout was void on its face for lack of proper notice to the grandsons. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. We conclude that notice to the grandsons was constitutionally sufficient, and thus, the Final Order was not void for lack of proper notice. Grandsons' challenge to the Final Order more than thirty years later is untimely.","4/17/2017 3:01:28 PM","OK"

In 2013, Mother filed a Notice of Intent to relocate with the child, and Father objected. The trial court denied Mother's application to relocate, concluding that the proposed relocation was not made in good faith and not in the best interest of the child. It also ordered each party to pay their own attorney fees. Mother appealed both judgments in separate companion cases, and both were affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. We hold that before a joint custodian can invoke the relocation provisions, the court must determine a primary physical custodian. We also hold that the trial court did not err in directing that each party pay their own fees.","","OK"

Dobson sought reimbursement for costs incurred when it was required by the City of Oklahoma City to relocate its telecommunications lines to accommodate the widening of a city street. The Oklahoma Universal Service Fund was established pursuant to the Oklahoma Telecommunications Act of 1997 to make funds available to eligible telecommunications service providers like Dobson ""to promote and ensure the availability of primary universal services, at rates that are reasonable and affordable . . . .""  17 O.S.2011 &sect; 139.106 (B). The Commission determined that reimbursement was not authorized unless the request to relocate had been made by a State agency. The Commission's interpretation defeats the purpose of the Fund. The Commission's Final Order is vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings.  1  ","3/22/2017 9:41:42 AM","OK CIV APP"

Nitz appeals the trial court's order denying his motion to reconsider an order dismissing Nitz's application to be removed from the requirement to register as a sex offender. The Oklahoma Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), 57 O.S.2011 &sect;&sect;581-590.2, allows registered sex offenders who were convicted under two Oklahoma statutes to seek an order removing their requirement to register as sex offenders. Nitz argued his conviction from another state was for a crime equivalent to one of the two statutes in the removal statute and that he was therefore eligible for removal from the registration requirement. The trial court found it was without jurisdiction to grant removal from the registration requirement for an out-of-state conviction. Nitz contends the trial court's interpretation of the relevant statutory provision violated his right to equal protection. The State has failed to file an answer brief and therefore this appeal proceeds on Nitz's brief only. On  de novo  review, we find the statute at issue violates Nitz's constitutional right to equal protection because it treats those convicted in other states differently than those convicted in Oklahoma and there is no rational basis for the disparate treatment. We reverse and remand for consideration of Nitz's application.","4/26/2017 8:54:35 AM","OK CIV APP"

They appeal the district court's September 22, 2015 and October 21, 2015 orders denying their motions for partial summary judgment and granting Appellee Vanessa Pierce's motions for partial summary judgment.  1   Appellants' motions challenged the validity of Pierce's devise in his 2013 Will of an interest in real property to Vanessa and their minor son, CP, arguing that the devise was superseded by a prenuptial agreement between Vanessa and Pierce. Appellants also argue that the devise to Vanessa and her son was ineffective to exercise a power of appointment regarding the property granted to Pierce in a trust that held title to the property. The district court's ruling that the devise in Pierce's Will was not precluded by the parties' prenuptial agreement is affirmed. The district court's ruling that the devise to Vanessa of a life estate in the property was invalid because she was not an object of the power of appointment is also affirmed. Finally, we affirm the district court's ruling that Pierce did effectively exercise his power of appointment regarding this real property in favor of his minor son.","5/11/2017 2:24:20 PM","OK CIV APP"

Meadows appeals the dismissal by the Oklahoma Tax Commission of his April 23, 2014 Application for Hearing. In that document, Meadows argued the Commission erred when it failed to enforce state income tax withholding law concerning a distribution from his employer-sponsored retirement account. The administrative law judge assigned to the matter treated Meadows' Application as an attempt to appeal the denial of two previous settlement proposals and determined that he did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter. The judge recommended that the Commission's Compliance Division's response to Meadows' Application be treated as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and be granted. The Commission adopted the administrative law judge's recommendation and dismissed Meadows' Application for Hearing. Because Meadows has abandoned any review of the denial of his settlement proposals, we vacate the Commission's order and remand this case for a hearing on Meadows' claim that the Commission failed to enforce Oklahoma withholding law.  1  ","5/11/2017 2:23:43 PM","OK CIV APP"

Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were residents at Epworth Villa's Oklahoma City facility when Mrs. Hicks suffered a broken wrist while under the care of Epworth Villa in its specialized, memory care unit. Mr. Hicks filed suit against Epworth Villa for breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (""IIED"") seeking both actual and punitive damages. On appeal Epworth Villa argues the trial court erred when it entered default judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract and negligence claims as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery orders. Epworth Villa also argues the trial court erred by ordering additional sanctions in the form of default judgment on Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages and by eliminating Epworth Villa's right to jury trial on the IIED claim. Further, Epworth Villa asserts the trial court erred in allowing the IIED claim to be tried and that the actual and punitive damages awarded by the court were excessive and not supported by the evidence. Additionally, Epworth Villa objects to the trial court's award of attorney fees and costs to Mr. Hicks, which was appealed separately from the underlying judgment and consolidated with this appeal by order of the Supreme Court.","5/11/2017 2:23:07 PM","OK CIV APP"
